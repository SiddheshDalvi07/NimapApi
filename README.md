# Django Project Management API

This project is a Django-based REST API for managing clients and projects. The API supports user authentication, CRUD operations for clients and projects, and ensures that project names are unique per client.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure API access with user authentication.
- **Client Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete clients.
- **Project Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete projects assigned to clients. Projects have a many-to-many relationship with users.
- **Custom Validation**: Ensures no two clients can have the same project name.

## Models

1. **Client**: Represents a company or entity that can have multiple projects.
2. **Project**: Represents a project associated with a client. Each project can have multiple users assigned.

## API Endpoints

### Client Endpoints

- **List all clients**: `GET /api/clients/`
- **Retrieve a client**: `GET /api/clients/<id>/`
- **Create a new client**: `POST /api/clients/`
- **Update a client**: `PUT /api/clients/<id>/`
- **Delete a client**: `DELETE /api/clients/<id>/`

### Project Endpoints

- **List all projects for the logged-in user**: `GET /api/projects/`
- **Retrieve a project**: `GET /api/projects/<id>/`
- **Create a new project**: `POST /api/projects/`
- **Update a project**: `PUT /api/projects/<id>/`
- **Delete a project**: `DELETE /api/projects/<id>/`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or 4.x
- Django REST Framework
- MySQL (or your preferred database)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-project-management-api.git
   cd django-project-management-api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the database:**

   Update your `settings.py` with your database configuration:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'yourdbname',
           'USER': 'yourdbuser',
           'PASSWORD': 'yourdbpassword',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '3306',
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the API:**

   Open your web browser or API client (such as Postman) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`

## Validation Rules

- **Unique Project Names**: A client cannot have two projects with the same name. A `ValidationError` will be raised if you try to create or update a project with a duplicate name for the same client.
  
  Example validation error response:
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "A project with the name 'Project X' already exists for client 'Client Y'."
  }
  ```

## Customizing the Project

- **Add Custom Validation**: The `Project` model has a custom `clean` method that ensures no two clients can have projects with the same name.

- **Handling Exceptions**: The project is configured to handle exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks in both the model's `save` method and the views.
